# dubai-appartments-price-prediction-scrapping

This project is aimed at finding a model that helps users (i.e. Authorities and Individuals)
find useful price related insights on the Real Estate market in Dubai. The current issue is that
pricing and valuation is done based on the market demands and with a surplus of supply
compared to demand, it becomes even more difficult and competitive to price these
properties. Some areas, that are highly attractive, have higher prices compared to other
properties that might be even better in terms of  transportation, and services available
around it. The model that is proposed, helps the users to make informed decisions when it
comes to purchasing or regulating the prices so that prices are not inflated, and
constructions is distributed more evenly across the Emirates. This might provide the Emirate
with a more stable real estate market and the residents with better information at hand.
This might also aid investors in selecting valuable properties to invest in and locations for
construction. It can also help property managers in properly pricing their units based on
their location and give them a competitive advantage. Moreover, new properties can use
the tool to determine the prices they should place on their properties based on several
factors such as location, age, unit type, floor level and other factors as well. Other benefits
from the model could be extracted to provide other valuable pieces of information to the
stakeholders
